## 🚀 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a **production-ready infinite scrolling system**
for rendering large lists efficiently. It uses **IntersectionObserver**
to load data progressively as the user scrolls, minimizing API calls and
improving performance.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Traditional pagination breaks user flow when browsing large datasets.
The goal was to:

- Load data **incrementally**
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders
- Prevent duplicate API calls
- Keep the UI smooth on low-end devices

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **React** – UI rendering
- **TypeScript** – Type safety
- **IntersectionObserver API** – Scroll detection
- **Zustand** – State management
- **REST API** – Backend pagination

---

## 🧩 Architecture

### Data Flow

1. Initial page loads first set of items
2. A sentinel element is observed at the bottom
3. When visible, next page is fetched
4. Data is appended (not replaced)
5. Observer pauses when no more pages exist

---

## 💡 Key Implementation Details

### Intersection Observer Setup

```ts
const observer = new IntersectionObserver((entries) => {
  if (entries[0].isIntersecting && hasNextPage) {
    loadNextPage();
  }
});
```
